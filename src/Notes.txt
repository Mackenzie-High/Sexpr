TODO:
+ Fix reporting locations of syntax errors during parsing (both expressions and schemas). 
+ Rename toAtom() and toList() to asAtom() and asList().
+ Check generics everywhere: Sexpr<?> instead of Sexpr.
+ Add a way of quickly and reliably computing the size of a Sexpr in chars and bytes.
+ Implement and test Builder stack.
+ Implement and test String Printer.
+ Improve exceptional causes by using custom exception types.
+ A Schema only needs validated once, not per match attempt.
+ Finish testing Sexpr Schema, including:
+ + Exceptions in actions.
+ + Exception is conditions.
+ + Escape sequences in strings.
+ + Schema immutability after calling build().
+ Test parseFile and parseResource.
+ + Normal Cases
+ + File/Resource not found.
+ Consider replacing SAtom constructors with factory methods.
