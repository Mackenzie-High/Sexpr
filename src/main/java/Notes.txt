+ Add a way of quickly and reliably computing the size of a Sexpr in chars and bytes.
+ Check generics everywhere: Sexpr<?> instead of Sexpr.


+ Implement and test String Printer.
+ Test reporting of syntax errors in schemas.
+ Improve exceptional causes by using custom exception types.

+ Finish testing Sexpr Schema, including:
+ + Exceptions in actions.
+ + Exception is conditions.
+ + Escape sequences in strings.
